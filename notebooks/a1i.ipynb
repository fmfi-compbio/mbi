        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this homework, your task is to implement and evaluate algorithms for comparing two genomes based on their sets of $k$-mers. Tasks 1 and 2 ask you to implement several techniques covered in [Tutorial 5](https://fmfi-compbio.github.io/mbi/notes/ci-aln2-en.html) for CS students. The remaining tasks ask you to observe the behavior of these techniques in terms of accuracy, running time and memory on real and simulated data.\n",

In the bonus version of task 2.1 you are allowed to research the algorithm in existing sources as explained below.  In **tasks 1 and 2 do not use AI to generate your code, switch off AI assistant** in your working environment (e.g. in Google Colab, in the main menu Tools -> Settings -> AI assistence -> Hide generative AI features). In tasks 3-6 you may use AI to help with setting up appropriate plots and tables, but if you do, acknowledge such help in comments in your code and make sure that the code is correct. Your discussion should be written in your own words, do not generate it using AI.   \n",

        "* In your code for tasks 1-2, use only libraries already imported in the provided code and functions provided by us, such as `canonical` and `kmer_hash`.\n",
        "* In tasks 3-6 you may use also other libraries. Measure all required quantities in the notebook and preferably also visualize them directly there. If you strongly prefer, you can create final visualizations in another system and submit this notebook as well as a separate pdf file with visualization and discussion.\n",
        "* Your notebook should be executable on Google Colab. If you use any libraries not available on Colab by default, install them using `pip install` commands included in the notebook (section Libraries for tasks 3-6). If you use a different environment to develop your code, test it in Colab before submitting.\n",

        "* Some computations may take a long time to run. Leave sufficient time for finish the assignment. If the computation takes too long, you may try to improve your implementation.\n",

        "* Tasks 3-6 ask you to make some measurements, summarize them in tables or plots and discuss your results. Include all these visualizations and discussion directly in this notebook.\n",
