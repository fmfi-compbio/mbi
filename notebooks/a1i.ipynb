        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this homework, your task is to implement and evaluate algorithms for comparing two genomes based on their sets of $k$-mers. Tasks 1 and 2 ask you to implement several techniques covered in [Tutorial 5](https://fmfi-compbio.github.io/mbi/notes/ci-aln2.html) for CS students. The remaining tasks ask you to observe the behavior of these techniques in terms of accuracy, running time and memory on real and simulated data.\n",

In the bonus version of task 2.1 you are allowed to research the algorithm in existing sources as explained below.  In **tasks 1 and 2 do not use AI to generate your code, switch off AI assistant** in your working environment (e.g. in Google Colab, in the main menu Tools -> Settings -> AI assistence -> Hide generative AI features). In tasks 3-6 you may use AI to help with setting up appropriate plots, but if you do, acknowledge such help in comments in your code and make sure that the plots correctly display the desired quantities. Your discussion should be written in your own words, do not generate it using AI.   \n",

        "* In tasks 3-6 you may use also other libraries. Measure all required quantities in the notebook and either visualize them directly there, or if you prefer, you can create final visualizations in another system.\n",

If you use any libraries not available on Colab by default, install them using `pip install` commands included in the notebook (section Libraries for tasks 3-6). If you use a different environment to develop your code, test it in Colab before submitting.\n",
        "* To avoid running out of memory, we recommend deleting variables that are no longer needed using `del` and occasionally calling `gc.collect()` to run garbage collection and free unused memory.\n",

        "* Tasks 3-6 ask you make some measurements, summarize them in tables or plots and discuss your results. You can include all these visualizations and discussion directly in this notebook, or if you prefer, you can submit them as a separate pdf (if you make plots in a different software).\n",
