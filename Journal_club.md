A brief description of the journal club activity is included in the [course rules](./Rules.html).

Please submit your preferences regarding these papers using [this form](https://forms.gle/K7BZJD5fA3wRmmXk8) until Wednesday Oct. 23, 2024, 22:00. In the form, include numbers of three papers from this list in the order of preference.

* Students from the same study program will typically not be in the same group.
* Preferences submitted earlier will be considered with higher priority.
* Also please indicate if you are willing to work in a group with English-speaking students (this means group discussions and final report in English)

## List of papers: 

* All links to papers should work in our University network (e.g.
    Eduroam or [proxy](https://uniba.sk/index.php?id=6828))

Details for the journal club group meeting

  - Remember that everyone should read the article before the first
    meeting
  - The first meeting should take place no later than November 22. The
    meeting can be online (e,g, in MS Teams) or in person. Try to choose
    a time suitable for all members of the group.
  - At least 24 hours before the first group meeting, post its date,
    time and location to the Journal club discussion forum in Moodle
  - After the first meeting, one representative of the group will post a
    short summary to the Journal club discussion forum in Moodle stating
    who attended the meeting, who apologized and who did not respond to
    the group and what was the outcome of the meeting - whether the
    group had problems with some parts of the article, whether it plans
    to meet again, whether they need a consultation with the
    instructors, etc. You do not need to report subsequent meetings,
    unless you need help.
  - Failure to hold the first meeting according to these rules may
    affect the grade of the final report.

Advice and instructions for the written report from the journal club

  - In the report, describe the main methods and results of the article
    in your own words
  - The report should be understandable for students of this course
    (both computer scientists and biologists), so explain the necessary
    terms that are not explained in the article
  - You do not have to cover the entire content of the article in the
    report and, conversely, you can use other resources
  - Try to express your own view of the topic, do not strictly follow
    the text of the article
  - The recommended length is about 1-2 pages per person. However, the
    report should form one coherent text, so agree well on the outline
    and division of work and spend some time at the end on combining and
    editing individual contributions into a coherent report.
  - The report should list the members of the group who have actively
    participated in its work. Students who are not on this list will
    receive zero points for the report.
