### Course objectives

This course is targeted at students of both computer science and life
science study programs. Lectures will be together for both groups.
Tutorials are held separately for CS and biology students.

  - Everyone: Overview of basic methods for analysis of biological
    sequences and other data sets in molecular biology.
  - CS: Algorithms and data structures, machine learning, probability.
    How to develop mathematical abstractions for real-world problems.
  - Biology: Mathematical models at the core of popular bioinformatics
    tools, how to use tools, interpretation of their results.
  - Everyone: Experience with interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Brief syllabus

Basic concepts from molecular biology, algorithms and machine learning.
Sequencing and assembling genomes. Gene finding. Sequence alignment.
Evolutionary models and phylogenetic trees. Comparative genomics. RNA
structure. Motif finding and gene expression analysis. Protein structure
and function. Selected current topics.

Students of computer science programs will focus on computer science
methods and mathematical modeling of the covered problems. Life science
students will focus on understanding and correct application of these
methods on real data.

### Literature

Many basic concepts can be found in the following textbooks:

  - **DEKM**: Durbin, Eddy, Krogh, Mitchison: Biological sequence
    analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids.
    Cambridge University Press 1998. Can be studied in the FMFI library
    under code I-INF-D-21
  - **ZB**: Zvelebil, Baum: Understanding Bioinformatics. Taylor &
    Francis 2008. Can be studied in the FMFI library under code
    I-INF-Z-2

The course also draws on scientific literature and other
materials.
