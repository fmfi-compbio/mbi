## Courses

  - Course 1-BIN-301 is for computer-science related programs, namely
    BIN, INF, mINF, mAIN, DAV (below denoted computer science)
  - Course 2-AIN-501 is for students from Faculty of Natural Sciences
    and physics (below denoted biology)

## Grading

  - 3 homework assignments 30% (10% each)
  - Journal club 10%
  - Quizzes 10% (each week 1%)
  - For computer science: final exam 50%
  - For biology: project 50%

To pass the course, you need to satisfy both requirements below
(otherwise Fx grade will be assigned):

  - overall at least 50% of points
  - computer science: at least 50% of points from the final exam
  - biology: active participation at tutorials

Final grade: A: 90+, B: 80+, C: 70+, D: 60+, E: 50+

Homeworks may have separate versions for computer science and biology students.

## Quizzes

Quizes can be found in Moodle. They appear each Thursday at 7pm and are due next Wednesday 10pm.

## Journal club

Journal club is a group activity, where each group studies one
scientific paper and rewrites it in their own words.

  - Each student will select from the provided list the three articles
    that are of highest interest to him/her.
  - According to these preferences, instructors will divide the students
    into groups. Each group will read a different article.
  - Each student first reads the assigned article individually.
  - Then the whole group meets, discusses the article and tries to
    clarify any questions or to find missing information in the
    literature.
  - If needed, the group meets several times or continues to communicate
    electronically. In case of questions about the article, the whole
    group or some of its members can also arrange consultations with the
    instructors.
  - The group writes a report, in which they explain in their own words
    the main methods and results of the article and other necessary
    concepts so that the text is understandable to students of this
    course (both computer scientists and biologists). You should also describe
    how the article relates to the topics covered during the lectures
    and how it was used or extended in later work.
  - More details on a [separate page](./Journal_club.html)


## Exam

The exam is primarily in a written form and takes 2-3 hours. The content
will be specified later. You can bring a cheat sheet: 2 pages of A4
paper with arbitrary content (handwritten or printed).

In the circumstances listed below the full written exam may be replaced by a combination of a shorter written exam and an oral exam. This applies to 

* students who do not pass the exam during the first, regular date, and need the second or even the third attempt,
* ERASMUS students who do not participate in Slovak lectures and tutorials.

On the oral part of the exam, you should be able to explain the theory behind the questions in the written part (terminology, algorithms, what they are used for etc.).


## Project

  - The project is done by biology students instead of exam.
  - We recommend starting working on the project during the semester and
    consult any questions during tutorials for biologists.
  - There will be deadlines for proposing the project and presenting intermediate results.
  - The final report will be due during the exam period, followed by a
    short personal meeting with discussion of the project.
  - More details later.

## Academic integrity

Cheating and plagiarism on homeworks and exams is a serious violation of
academic integrity.

On homeworks, you are **not allowed** to copy other person's work (eg
from a classmate, from the Internet including AI chatbots, or from
scientific literature) and submit it as your own. You are also not
allowed to let another person to copy your solution. We allow and
encourage discussion among students about individual homework tasks.
However, the solutions you submit must be your own work written in your
own words. To avoid unnecessary problems, do not take notes during group
discussions about homework and wait at least three hours after such a
discussion before writing the solution to be submitted.

During exams, do not use unauthorized aids and do not communicate with
persons other than the instructors.

In the report from the journal club, you must cite all used literature.
Express the knowledge you have gained on the topic in your own words. Do
not copy or mechanically translate entire sentences from the paper and
other sources (except for short direct quotes indicating the source).
Create your own images or specify the source of the downloaded images
used in the report. Similarly for project reports.

When cheating or plagiarism is detected, we will normally assign a grade
of 0 for the relevant part of the work, with a minimum reduction of the
final grade by one grade. Cheating on the exam will result in the FX
grade for the exam. Serious violations of academic
integrity will be also referred to the dean of the faculty.
